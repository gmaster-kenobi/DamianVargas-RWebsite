        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Damian Vargas. I am currently a Business Economics major switching to Business Accounting in the future. I am very tech savvy as I have been working with computers since I was a child. I am proficient in Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. I am a very quick learner, especially when it comes to learning new programs or operations. I also have some experience in writing html code. I am a very impatient guy, when I want something, I get it done as soon as possible. I am a quick and efficient worker. I like to stay on schedule and not leave things to the last minute. I consider math to be my best subject, but I also excel at writing. I enjoy writing essays, especially on topics I am passionate about or I think deserve to be talked about. I currently work at AutoZone as a customer sales representative. I help customers find the right parts for their vehicles whether it be cars, trucks, trailers, motorcycles, atvs, etc. I also help maintain the store as far as cleanliness and organization. The store at which I work tends to get really busy so work quickly and efficiently is a requirement to keep up with demand from the customers. I also help close the store during late night shifts. We count the registers and safe and set the alarm before we leave. A lot of the skills I’ve learned or expanded upon have been from gaining experience working this position. I have learned to deal with difficult customers, difficult situations, and working diligently under pressure and limited time. Problem solving is a skill also required as different and unique problems come with the job and I have learned how to solve them on a basis by basis situation. We also interact with our sister stores to transfer parts or communicate whether or not they have the parts a customer needs but we don’t currently carry at our store. We also deal with auto parts vendors as sometimes in order for us to get our customers a part, it must be ordered straight from the vendor themselves. We also have to, at times, outside buy parts as we might not offer the part, but wish to close a sale. In that case we outside buy the part, usually done for commercial clients. I have worked with Excel for some time now. I first started working with Excel in 8th grade when I took a computer literacy course. We learned the basics of Excel and I continued to expand my knowledge on Excel when helping my mother with some of her Excel work. I expanded my knowledge with Excel even more recently with taking a Computer Science class at the University of California, Riverside. Along with Excel, I have experience with Microsoft Access as well. I am very efficient with Word and PowerPoint as well as I have worked with those programs since middle school. I’ve worked with them for around 7 years now.<br><br>
